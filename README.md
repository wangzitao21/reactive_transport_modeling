# reactive_transport_modeling

This repository is dedicated to modeling workflows for studying reactive transport processes in salt lake brine systems. The work combines `Python` for generating stochastic fields representing heterogeneous porous media and `MATLAB` scripts for coupling `COMSOL` Multiphysics and `PHREEQC`. These tools are used to simulate the fluid flow, solute transport, and chemical reactions critical to understanding brine dynamics and resource extraction in salt lakes.

The complete modeling workflow, including scripts, data, and detailed documentation, will be made publicly available in subsequent updates.
